# FFXIV Free Company Search

Welcome to the Final Fantasy XIV Free Company Search! Here you can easily and quickly search for any free company in all of Final Fantasy XIV! You are also able to pull the roster of each Free Company and see their FFXIV ID as well as Free Company Rank.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ffxiv'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ffxiv

## Usage

To use this application, it's as easy as 1, 2, and 3! Simply run the start file called "ffxiv" within the bin file. Then follow the prompts! Type in the name of a Free Company and optionally add a server name if known(server name must be spelled correctly to help with the search). Then say yes if you would like to have the members displayed, then select the number associated with said Free Company. Feel free to do another search after this is displayed otherwise you may exit the application!
